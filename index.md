Hi there, this is me. I love crunching numbers and solving equations. I am always learning something new, like writing a webpage now. I write [SAS Macro](https://github.com/dajuntian/SAS-Snippet), [wrap up R package]((https://github.com/dajuntian/emr4washu), play with Python and also publish papers. English is not my native language and I usually catch 80% of what people are talking. And looks like 80% is enough.
