Hi there, this is me. I am always learning something new, like writing a webpage now. I write [SAS Macro](https://github.com/dajuntian/SAS-Snippet), wrap up [R package](https://github.com/dajuntian/emr4washu), play with [Python](https://github.com/dajuntian/twitter-mining-workshop) and also publish [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z-fcZOwAAAAJ&hl=en).

English is not my native language and I usually catch 80% of what people are talking about. And looks like 80% is enough.
